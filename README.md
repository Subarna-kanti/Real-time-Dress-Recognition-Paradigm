Fabricated a pipe-line for real-time dress recognition as the video analytics solution for a retail store, recording the dress wore by the customers entering the store. Trained a CNN model to recognize the dresses using the scraped dataset built using Selenium. The pipe-line uses the YoloV3 object detection model to detect the person, whose clothes were later recognized by the trained CNN model.
